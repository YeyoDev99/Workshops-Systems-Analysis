# Workshop 2 â€” System Design (Summary)

## Objective
Build upon the systems analysis from **Workshop 1** to create a robust **system design** that addresses challenges, requirements, and chaotic/sensitive aspects identified earlier.

---

## Key Tasks

### 1. Review of Workshop 1 Findings
- Summarize critical constraints, dataset characteristics, and chaos/sensitivity aspects.  
- Ensure the proposed design directly addresses these findings.

### 2. Define System Requirements
- Translate analysis into measurable design requirements (performance, reliability, scalability).  
- Consider user needs: interpretability, usability, and security.

### 3. High-Level Architecture
- Propose an architectural blueprint including:  
  - **Data ingestion**  
  - **Preprocessing/ETL**  
  - **Feature engineering**  
  - **Model training & validation**  
  - **Deployment & monitoring**  
- Apply **systems engineering principles** (modularity, scalability, maintainability).  

### 4. Sensitivity & Chaos Mitigation
- Strategies to handle sensitive inputs, noisy data, and feedback loops.  
- Monitoring, error handling, and stability mechanisms for unpredictable conditions.  

### 5. Technical Stack & Implementation
- Recommend tools/frameworks (e.g., Python, R, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Docker).  
- Justify choices in terms of scalability, reproducibility, and maintainability.  
- Outline integration plan and potential design patterns.  

---

## Deliverables
- **System Design Document (PDF)** â†’ stored in `workshop2/` (or `Workshop_2_Design/`).  
- **README.md update** â†’ explaining process, diagrams, and linking to final PDF.  
- **Diagrams** â†’ System architecture, data flow, and module interactions.  

---

## Deadline
ðŸ“… **October 18th, 2025 â€” 12:00 PM**  
Late submissions may incur penalties.  

---

## Notes
- Report must be in **English** and in **PDF format**.  
- Must reference **Workshop 1 outcomes**.  
- Emphasize how **chaos theory** and **sensitivity analysis** informed the design.  
- Treat this as an **evolving blueprint** for future workshops.  
- Consider broader **real-world applications** beyond the Kaggle competition.
